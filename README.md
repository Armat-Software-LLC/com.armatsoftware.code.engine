# Purpose
Purpose of this effort is to create an easy to use library for run-time composition, compilation, resolution, and execution of custom logic.

# Progress
So far, I have created the essential core elements of the library - contracts, some default implementations, and tests that demonstrate what it is and how to use it. I am now working on refinement of the existing logic to align with the future goals.

# Goals
There are two main goals that seem to make sense to pursue going forward:
- Create an environment to conveniently compose and immediately test custom logic at run time
- Seamlessly integrate the custom logic into the dependency resolution pipeline to enable run-time test and utiilization of the composed custom logic
